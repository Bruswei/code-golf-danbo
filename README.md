This is an internal code challenge for Danbo-day.

## How to Enter the Code Challenge

1. **Setup**:

   - Clone the repository.

   }
   ```

   - Test your solution with command `npm run test`

3. **If you are competing remotely**

   - Set a timer for one hour, you have to complete the challenge within the time limit. (Our best within one hour was 154 characters)
   - After one hour, please make sure all your code is inside the sol function as mentioned above.
